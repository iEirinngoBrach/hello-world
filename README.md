My First attempt at fallowing directions
Hey everyone, Jesse here. Im new to Coding and Programing and it seems all roads leed here so i think this is probably the best place to learn. Im into Pen testing, Kali linux, Parrotsec OS, Python and C++ and Tech stuff. I appriciate any and all advice and help I recieve from the people here at Git. I look forward to this experience.
